    The Inspiring Soul Babu Banarasi Das Ji, a Gallant young man of Bulandshahar (U.P.) joined the freedom struggle of the country and had to undergo imprisonment several times for his participation in non-violent movement of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawahar Lal Nehru. During his long political career he worked as a Minister, Speaker and Member of Parliament (both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and later on served as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. His entire life was devoted to secure the dignity of individuals; help and guide people of all ages in every walk of life, to enable them realize their full potential and self-satisfaction in life. He never believed in surrendering to any forces, and even when coming face to face with DEATH, he would not give in " Man doth not yield himself to angels, not even unto death, utterly, save, by the weakness of his feeble will.
        He led and inspired people by his own example and has left a legacy worth emulating to enlighten the path of current and future generation. We are privilege to own that legacy and perpetuate his memory to help the people in service of Nation and God. BBDNITM is one many such efforts to cherish the memory of the great.
